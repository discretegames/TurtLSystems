# **[TurtLSystems][pypi]**

[Intro][intro] | [Installation][install] | [Usage][usage] | [L-System Instructions][inst] | [Examples][ex] | [Links][links]

[TurtLSystems][pypi] is a Python 3 package for drawing [L-systems][wiki] via [turtle graphics][turtle]
with easy ways to output png images and gif animations of the patterns generated.
L-systems or Lindenmayer systems are a simple string rewriting systems where every character in an initial start
string is repeatedly overwritten with a predetermined replacement. This can lead to very elaborate patterns that mimic
nature or create fractals.

# Installation (supports Python 3.6+)

Make sure you have [Python][py] installed then run this command in a terminal:

```text
pip install TurtLSystems
```

If that doesn't work try one of the following lines:

```text
pip3 install TurtLSystems
python -m pip install TurtLSystems
python3 -m pip install TurtLSystems
py -m pip install TurtLSystems
```

For png and gif output the [Ghostscript][gs] conversion tool is required. It can be downloaded [here][gsd]. Ghostscript is
what takes the .eps files generated by turtle graphics and turns them into pngs which are then made into gifs.

The Python imaging library [Pillow][pillowdoc] (PIL) is also required for png and gif output but it will be installed
automatically when you install TurtLSystems.

# Usage

TurtLSystems has only four functions, [`init`][init], [`draw`][draw], [`wait`][wait], and [`lsystem`][lsystem],
and only the `draw` function is strictly necessary.

The code that generated [the blue gif][example] of the [Sierpinski arrowhead curve][arrowheadwiki] above is simply:

```py
from TurtLSystems import *
draw('A', 'A B-A-B B A+B+A,', 5, 60, 7, 2, (200, 220, 255), None, (36, 8, 107),
     heading=60, red_increment=2, gif='example.gif', max_frames=250, duration=30)
```

A typical program might look like:

```py
from TurtLSystems import init, draw, wait
init(...)  # fill in args
draw(...)  # fill in args
wait()
```

To ignore the errors that get thrown when exiting the window while the turtle is drawing use try/except with `Exit`:

```py
from TurtLSystems import init, draw, wait, Exit
try:
    init(...)  # fill in args
    draw(...)  # fill in args
    wait()
except Exit:
    pass
```

## `init` Function

Initializes global TurtLSystems properties.
Calling this is optional and only needed when customization is desired.
If used it should only be called once and placed before all calls to `draw` and `wait`.

Returns nothing.

### Arguments

| Name<br>`Default` | Description<br>`Type` |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- |
| window_size<br>`(0.75, 0.75)` | The size of the window. Use integers for pixel dimensions. Use floats for a percentage of the screen size.<br>`Tuple[int \| float, int \| float]`
| window_title<br>`"TurtLSystems"` | The title of the window.<br>`str`
| background_color<br>`(0, 0, 0)` | The background color of the window. A 0-255 rgb tuple. May be changed later by draw calls.<br>`Tuple[int, int, int]`
| background_image<br>`None` | The file path to a background image for the window.<br>`str \| None`
| window_position<br>`None` | The top and left screen coordinates of the window, or None for centered.<br>`Tuple[int \| None, int \| None] \| None`
| canvas_size<br>`None` | The size of the drawing canvas when an area larger than the window size is desired.<br>`Tuple[int \| None, int \| None] \| None`
| ghostscript<br>`None` | The path to or command name of ghostscript. When None, an educated guess of the path is made on Windows and 'gs' is used on Mac/Linux. [Ghostscript][gsd] is the image conversion tool required for png and gif output.<br>`str \| None`
| logo_mode<br>`False` | Whether the turtle graphics coordinates mode is 'standard' or 'logo'. Defaults to standard. In standard mode an angle of 0 points rightward and positive angles go counterclockwise. In logo mode an angle of 0 points upward and positive angles go clockwise.<br>`bool`
| delay<br>`None` | The turtle graphics animation delay in milliseconds. None for default value.<br>`int \| None`
| silent<br>`False` | Whether to silence all messages and warnings produced by TurtLSystems.<br>`bool`

If you have issues where png or gif output is cut off and doesn't match what is shown in the window, try increasing
the canvas size to much larger than needed like `init(canvas_size(2000, 2000))`.
I experienced this issue in Linux Mint and am not sure why it happened.

## `draw` Function

Opens a turtle graphics window and draws an L-system pattern based on the arguments provided.
When called multiple times all patterns are drawn to the same canvas.

All 54 arguments are optional but `start` and `rules` are the most important because they define the L-system,
and `level` defines how many expansion steps take place. On an expansion step, every character in `start` is
replaced with what it maps to in `rules` (or left unchanged if not present) resulting in a new `start` string.
The characters of `start` after the last expansion are the [instructions][inst] the turtle follows to draw a pattern.
See the [`lsystem`][lsystem] function documentation for specifics on what each character does as an instruction.

Call `draw()` by itself to see an example Sierpinski triangle pattern.

In the descriptions below, "on X" is short for "when the character X is encountered in the L-system string".

Returns a 2-tuple of the final L-system string and the turtle graphics Turtle object used to draw the pattern
(`Tuple[str, turtle.Turtle]`).

### Positional Arguments

| Name<br>`Default` | Description<br>`Type` |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- |
| start<br>`'F+G+G'` | The initial string or axiom of the L-system. Level 0.<br>`str`
| rules<br>`'F F+G-F-G+F G GG'` | Dictionary that maps characters to what they are replaced with in the L-system expansion step. May also be a string where whitespace separated pairs of substrings correspond to the character and its replacement. For example `{'A': 'AB', 'B': 'B+A'}` and `'A AB B B+A'` represent the same rules.<br>`Dict[str, str] \| str`
| level<br>`4` | The number of L-system expansion steps to take, i.e. how many times to apply `rules` to `start`.<br>`int`
| angle<br>`120` | The angle to turn by on `+` or `-`. In degrees by default but the `circle` arg can change that.<br>`float`
| length<br>`20` | The distance in pixels to move forward by on letters. The length step.<br>`float`
| thickness<br>`1` | The line width in pixels. May be any non-negative number.<br>`float`
| color<br>`(255, 255, 255)` | The line color. A 0-255 rgb tuple or None to hide all lines. Reselected on `0`.<br>`Tuple[int, int, int] \| None`
| fill_color<br>`(128, 128, 128)` | The fill color for `{}` polygons, `@` dots, and turtle shapes. A 0-255 rgb tuple or None to hide all fills. Reselected on `1`.<br>`Tuple[int, int, int] \| None`
| background_color<br>`None` | The background color of the window. A 0-255 rgb tuple or None to leave unchanged.<br>`Tuple[int, int, int] \| None`
| asap<br>`False` | When True the draw will happen as fast as possible, ignoring `speed` arg and the `delay` arg of `init`.<br>`bool`

Each may be a 0-255 rgb tuple or None for no color. The list of defaults below is used to fill out anything missing if less than 10 colors are given. When `colors` is None, `color` and `fill_color` are used replace slots 0 and 1 respectively.<br>`Iterable[Tuple[int, int, int] \| None] \| None`
| position<br>`(0, 0)` | The initial (x, y) position of the turtle.<br>`Tuple[float, float]`
| heading<br>`0` | The initial angle the turtle points in.<br>`float`
| scale<br>`1'` | A factor to scale the size of the pattern by. May be negative. Specifically, `length`, `position`, and `length_increment` are multiplied by `scale` and `thickness` and `thickness_increment` are multiplied by `abs(scale)`.<br>`float`
| prefix<br>`''` | An L-system string that does not undergo expansion prepended to the fully expanded `start` string.<br>`str`
| suffix<br>`''` | An L-system string that does not undergo expansion appended to the fully expanded `start` string<br>`str`

### Advanced Arguments

| Name<br>`Default` | Description<br>`Type` |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- |

| skip_init<br>`False` | Whether to skip calling `init` when it hasn't been called already.<br>`bool`

## `wait` Function

Keeps window open. Calling this is optional.
If used it should only be called once and be placed after all calls to `draw`.

Expands the L-system string `start` according to `rules` `level` number of times, returning the resulting string.

The `draw` function calls this internally. You do you not need to call it unless you want to.

The types and descriptions of `start`, `rules`, and `level`
in this function match exactly what they are in the [`draw`][draw] function.

# L-System Instructions
